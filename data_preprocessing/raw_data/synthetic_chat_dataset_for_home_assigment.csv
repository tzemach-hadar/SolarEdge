You'll need an on-site inspection to verify.<br>Customer 7: Who should I contact for that?<br>Agent 5: Your original installer should handle this. If they're unavailable, I can recommend certified technicians in your area."
8,1/18/2024 15:22,"Agent 3: Good afternoon! This is Agent 3 from SolarEdge support. How can I assist you?<br>Customer 8: I submitted an RMA request 3 days ago but haven't received confirmation.

I'm losing patience.<br>Agent 3: I completely understand your frustration. Looking at your case, there was a delay in our European warehouse.<br>Customer 13: I don't care about your warehouse issues. I need my replacement now.<br>Agent 3: You're absolutely right. I'm going to escalate this to our logistics director immediately.<br>Customer 13: What does that mean exactly?<br>Agent 3: It means your replacement will ship within 24 hours, guaranteed. I'll personally monitor this."
14,1/21/2024 16:33,"Agent 1: Good afternoon! Thank you for contacting SolarEdge. I'm Agent 1. How can I help you?<br>Customer 14: My monitoring shows one optimizer with much lower output than others. Is this normal?<br>Agent 1: Some variation is normal, but significant differences indicate a problem. What's the site ID?<br>Customer 14: Site 8841726. Optimizer 405G7H9K is producing 50% less than similar units.<br>Agent 1: I can see the performance discrepancy. This could be shading, soiling, or a hardware issue.<br>Customer 14: All panels are clean and no shading issues.<br>Agent 1: In that case, it's likely a hardware problem with the optimizer. We should replace it under warranty.<br>Customer 14: How do I proceed with the warranty claim?<br>Agent 1: I'll start the warranty process now. You should receive confirmation within 2 hours."
15,1/22/2024 9:45,"Agent 4: Hello! Welcome to SolarEdge technical support. I'm Agent 4.

The system needs 2-3 days to optimize performance."
16,1/22/2024 13:20,"Agent 2: Good afternoon! This is Agent 2 from SolarEdge support. How may I help you today?<br>Customer 16: My inverter display is completely blank but the system seems to be working. What's wrong?<br>Agent 2: A blank display doesn't necessarily mean system failure. Let me check your remote monitoring.<br>Customer 16: The monitoring app shows normal production, so that's confusing.<br>Agent 2: I can confirm your system is producing normally. This appears to be just a display issue.<br>Customer 16: Is the display important for operation?<br>Agent 2: The display is mainly for local monitoring. System operation doesn't depend on it.<br>Customer 16: Should I still get it fixed?<br>Agent 2: It's not urgent, but I can arrange a warranty repair if you prefer having the display functional."
